Wood Paneling and Flooring Texture Pack
By: Edmund Dubois
Date Created: August 1, 2014

This texture pack is created to give nice-looking wood textures of various forms for people looking to add some nice wood wall paneling, floorboards, or floor paneling to their levels or environments. Thank you for purchasing it, I hope you find it useful!

The texture pack contains the following:
1. 6 sample matierals using the textures I have created, as well as a sample scene demonstrating them
2. Diffuse, Specular, and Normal mapping for the 6 different wood textures I created, in PNG format at 1024x1024 pixels apiece.

No real setup is required, just import the package into your project of choice and everything will be in a "Wood Paneling and Flooring Texture Pack" folder for you to use as you see fit!

Note: Because of the way Unity handles floating point rounding accuracy, you might see a seam between the bottom segment of wall paneling and the rest of it in the sample scene. This is solved by turning the Pixel Light Count setting up to 10 in the Quality settings of the project (Edit -> Project Settings -> Quality). Rest assured the textures do tile properly!

Thank you again for purchasing the package, feedback is appreciated!
